* For my website I used Farmer Motion for animations. I gave an effect to the home page with React Type Writer. I used it for transtech query op.

* I have implemented login registration with firebase. A sweet alert can be seen if the user successfully logs in. Even after registration, you can see it. While logging in or registering, a set of messages will be shown below the input field.

* Users can sell, buy, delete, or update services on my website

* I have added pagination to my website. Pagination is fully functional. And added the search function.
